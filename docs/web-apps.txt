Web Apps
===============

I started working with information technologies around 1998 in New York City during the last years of my undergraduate degree in music. In the beginning there were Web Sites.

<!-- My education in programming happened in reverse. From self-taught informal to . What started with HTML and CSS has turned into a general interest in programming languages. Almost everything I have ever programmed is a Web App in some form ... almost.  -->

This is a list of recent Web Apps. I have noted the technologies used in each for interest. The app you are looking at now was written in [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org) for the [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com) micro-framework, using the [heroku-docs](http://github.com/heroku/heroku-docs) codebase and deployed (for the moment) on [Heroku](http://heroku.com). One person, two hours. A lot has changed since '98.
