Musical Performance
===================

Between 1998 and about 2004 I produced and performed music with a number of collaborators in New York. In addition to DJing dozens of clubs, performance highlights include

* Whitney Muesum of Modern Art: Bitstreams opening exhibition
* Appearance with C&eacute;line, opening for Funckstorug at Pianos (2002).
* SINFest 2000 (with <a href="http://toshoklabs.com/" target="_blank">toskoklabs</a>).
* Knitting Factory, NYC: Record Camp artist showcase.
* Blasthaus Gallery, SF (1999): with Basicray.
* Dumbo Arts Fest (2000).
