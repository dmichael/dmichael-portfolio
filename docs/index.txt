I like to make things.
======================


I started working with information technologies around 1998 in New York City during the last years of my undergraduate degree (in music), when the internet's possibilities had been realized, but viable business models had not.

My first job was an internship with a company called Sybarite which is no longer around, but who's owner went on to found LivePerson, which is.

Application developer working in various technologies with a focus on networked apps. Researcher in adaptive behavior and bioacoustics. Nature recordist.


What is the origin of music? 

Is non-human life only the evolutionary basis of our music, 
or is "music" a more fundamental feature of using the acoustic channel for communications - an implicit phenomena (or epiphenomena) of bioacoustics?
