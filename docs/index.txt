Hello world
======================

I have made many different versions of my portfolio over the years, each catering to a different audience. While this strategy for image control has not been unkind, it has felt schizophrenic, splitting my work into separate identities that all require maintenance.

So here we try something new: A unified approach to the presentation of self, a portfolio of the diverse productions I have made over the years grouped as logically as possible.

<br />

__I currently maintain identity on a few other networks.__

__Some topics informing my recent work __

* Set notation finders using named scopes, service oriented architectures, and lightweight authentication & authorization in Rails

* Technologies for large volume, high availability datasets (Hadoop, iSCSI SAN arrays)

* Ecology and ecological modeling

* Surround and unattended field recording techniques

* Writing Java in MATLAB (JamLab)

* Call-timing algorithms of frogs, toads, and insects

<!-- * Is non-human life only the evolutionary basis of our music, or is "music" a more fundamental feature of using the acoustic channel for communications - an implicit phenomena (or epiphenomena) of bioacoustics? What is the origin of music?  -->
